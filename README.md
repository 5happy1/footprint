# footprint

Take a picture of your meal and find out how much water went into it - it's "water footprint". See it in action [here](https://5happy1.github.io/footprint/)!

This is coded primarily in React and uses the Microsoft Cognitive Services API for image recognition. The dataset of different foods' water footprints is currently small and needs to be expanded. We retrieved it from [here](https://github.com/evgenyneu/water-footprint-web/blob/master/_data/data_en.tsv).

footprint was created at HackDuke 2017 by Samuel Rabinowitz, Mary Gooneratne, and Luke Sallmen.
